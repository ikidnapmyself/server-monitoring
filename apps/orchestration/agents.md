# apps.orchestration — Agent Notes

This file contains **app-local** guidance for working in `apps/orchestration/`.

## Role in the pipeline

This app is the **only pipeline controller**.

Core rule: **one orchestrator, one trace**
- Only `apps.orchestration` is allowed to move work across stages.
- Every run must propagate `trace_id/run_id` across logs, monitoring, DB records, and outbound notifications.

## Responsibilities

The orchestrator owns:
- State machine: `INGESTED → CHECKED → ANALYZED → NOTIFIED` (+ failure/retry states)
- Stage contract enforcement (structured DTOs)
- Persistence/audit trail (`PipelineRun`, `StageExecution`, output snapshots/refs)
- Observability (mandatory stage boundary signals)
- Failure & retry policy (including intelligence fallback when configured)

## Monitoring signals (minimum)

Emit, at least:
- `pipeline.stage.started`
- `pipeline.stage.succeeded`
- `pipeline.stage.failed` (with `retryable=true/false`)
- duration metric

Required tags/fields:
- `trace_id/run_id`, `incident_id`, `stage`, `source`, `alert_fingerprint`, `environment`, `attempt`

## Key modules

- `apps/orchestration/orchestrator.py` — pipeline implementation
- `apps/orchestration/tasks.py` — Celery task entrypoints
- `apps/orchestration/models.py` — `PipelineRun`, `StageExecution`
- `apps/orchestration/executors.py` / `dtos.py` — stage execution helpers and DTOs
- `apps/orchestration/urls.py` — URL routing

## App layout rules (required)

- Endpoints must live under `apps/orchestration/views/` (endpoint/module-based).
  - Example: `views/pipeline.py`, `views/status.py`
- Tests must live under `apps/orchestration/_tests/` and mirror the module tree.
  - Example: `orchestrator.py` → `_tests/test_orchestrator.py` (or `_tests/orchestrator/test_pipeline.py`)
  - Example: `views/pipeline.py` → `_tests/views/test_pipeline.py`

## Doc vs code status

Tests have been migrated to `_tests/` (completed). Some code still uses monolithic `views.py`; migrate to `views/` package when touching related code.

## Django Admin expectations

Each app must provide an **extensive** `admin.py` so operators can manage its models and trace pipeline behavior.

For `apps.orchestration`, admin is the primary operations surface and should:
- Provide rich list/detail views for `PipelineRun` and `StageExecution` (filters, search, durations, attempts)
- Make it easy to traverse `PipelineRun` → `StageExecution` → linked `Incident`/artifacts
- Expose retry/failure context clearly (error type/message, retryable flag, attempt count)
- Ensure any stored payloads/prompts are redacted (show refs, not secrets)
